##### We can see from the analysis that there are much more rides sharing in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. There are a lot more drivers in urban areas as opposed to rural areas and of course the fare charge is a lot cheapter in urban than rural areas.
##### We have pulled out weekly rides data to compare the fares and we can see disparity between urban and rural ride data.

### Summary
##### 1. There is so small number of drivers in rural areas compared to urban areas. If the goal is to raise the number of rides in rural areas, there has to be more drivers hiring in rural area.
##### 2. Average fare for rural area is more than 3 times higher than urban areas. It is natural because there are not many drivers in rural areas. When we fix the problem of small number of drivers, this problem will hopefully settle.
##### 3. There are not many rides going on in rural areas compared to urban areas. Actually, the number of rides in rural areas is about one tenth of the volume of urban area rides. In order to fix this problem and have more rides in rural areas, we have to have more drivers available.
